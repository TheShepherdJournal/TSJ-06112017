**Shepherd Middle School:** Dear Parents, Guardians, and Students,Without taking away the fun of summertime, what are some strategies we can use to avoid the "summer slide?"We are all happy that the children have a break from busy school days, but we also want to avoid the summer slide. The summer slide happens when our students lose some of the academic skills and learning that they gained during the school year due to the absence of quality learning activities during summer break. As the old saying goes, “Use it, or lose it.” We all want our students to be at their “Bluejay Best” when they come back to school in the fall!Here are our tips to avoid the summer slide:Math- keep your skills sharp by practicing math facts, playing logic games/puzzles, or utilize one of the web resources listed below:

English/Language Arts - set goals to keep reading over the summer! Students are challenged to make reading a part of every day. Students can take the SMS Summer Reading Challenge and return it in the fall to win books and prizes! Students can also do some journal writing. Here are some web resources for ELA:

Don't forget to keep asking, "Why?’

Social Studies - learn while vacationing! If you are planning on taking a vacation this summer, you can turn it into a social studies activity. Ask your child to research the destination's history, cuisine, popular attractions, etc. Also, once you reach your vacation destination, you can schedule tours of famous landmarks and locations, which will increase social studies knowledge.Fitness - Don’t forget to do lots of running, jumping and swimming! Take a long walk together as a family or go for a bike ride. After all, these kinds of activities are what summer is all about!I wish you all a very happy, fun-filled summer!

Sincerely,

Mrs. Eckhardt

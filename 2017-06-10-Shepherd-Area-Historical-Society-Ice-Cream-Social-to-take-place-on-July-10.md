The Shepherd Area Historical Society will be hosting an Ice Cream Social on July 10 at 6 p.m. in the Village Park. Everybody in the community is invited. The Central Michigan Area Concert Band will perform later that same evening at 7:00 P.M.

Donations are welcomed. Remember to bring lawn chairs so that you can feel comfortable while enjoying the desserts and the music.

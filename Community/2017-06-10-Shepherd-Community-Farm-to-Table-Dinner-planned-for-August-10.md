Some more details shared on the [Farm to Table Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Shepherd-Community-Farm-to-Table-Dinner-459294594280364/):

* Love that Jenny Packer! She has graciously welcomed us into her kitchen to make ready for the dinner on August 10 and is lending us a lot of equipment that would otherwise force us to dig deeper into our linty pockets.

* Kent Roth has been right on board with us since the very beginning of the Farm to Table Dinner project. With every forkful that we take on August 10, we will be thankful to Kent for the use of his silverware and so much more.

* Tim Daugherty is one spicy local gardener, as will be proven at dinner with his donation of hot peppers.

* When we sit down to eat on August 10, we will have Jay Travis to thank for the tables and chairs. And we will thank Merlie Koutz for the serving tables. What big hearted neighbors we have

Mitchell's Gourmet Deli, Marritaâ€™s, and Shepherd Bar & Restaurant will be holding fundraisers in the near future which will benefit the Farm to Table event.

The Farm to Table group is still in need of help from the community:

* monetary donations

* Silent Auction items and packages

* locally grown flowers

* volunteers to decorate on August 10. 

If you are interested in helping, contact one of the committee members listed above. Or you can mail donations to:
